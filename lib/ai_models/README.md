# AI Models for URL Analysis

This directory contains the AI module for URL analysis in the Alris application. This README is specifically for the AI team working on implementing URL detection functionality.

## Overview

The AI module is responsible for analyzing URLs and determining their safety, categorization, and potential risks. The module follows a predefined interface to ensure seamless integration with the main application.

## File Structure

```
ai_models/
├── ai_analyzer.dart    # Core interface and dummy implementation
├── README.md          # This file
└── [future files]     # Additional model implementations, utilities, etc.
```

## Getting Started

1. Examine the interface in `ai_analyzer.dart`
2. Create your implementation class that implements the `AIAnalyzer` interface
3. Run tests to ensure your implementation meets requirements

## Implementation Options

Your AI model implementation can use:

1. **On-device Processing**:
   - TensorFlow Lite for Flutter
   - ML Kit integration
   - Custom models with local processing

2. **API-based Approach**:
   - Cloud AI services (e.g., Google Cloud AI, AWS Rekognition)
   - Custom backend with Flask/FastAPI

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Local pre-processing with cloud-based analysis
   - Cached results with online verification

## Technical Requirements

Your implementation must:

1. Follow the `AIAnalyzer` interface defined in `ai_analyzer.dart`
2. Handle errors gracefully (e.g., network failures, malformed URLs)
3. Be efficient with resources (minimize battery drain, memory usage)
4. Provide meaningful analysis results
5. Work offline when possible (or degrade gracefully)
6. Pass all tests in `test/ai_models/ai_analyzer_test.dart`

## Expected AI Capabilities

At minimum, your implementation should identify:

1. **Safety Analysis**:
   - Phishing detection
   - Malware links
   - Suspicious URL patterns
   - Known malicious domains

2. **Content Categorization**:
   - Website type (e.g., business, social, education)
   - Content classification
   - Age appropriateness

3. **Threat Assessment**:
   - Threat score (0-100)
   - Confidence level
   - Specific risks identified

## Integration with App

Your implementation will be used by:

```dart
// Example app integration
final aiAnalyzer = YourImplementation();
final result = await aiAnalyzer.analyzeUrl(userInputUrl);

// The result will be displayed to the user
displaySafetyScore(result.safetyScore);
showCategories(result.categories);
listWarnings(result.warnings);
```

## Testing Your Implementation

To test your implementation:

```
flutter test test/ai_models/ai_analyzer_test.dart
```

## Resources

- [TensorFlow Lite Flutter Plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_flutter)
- [ML Kit for Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mlkit_commons)
- [HTTP Package](https://pub.dev/packages/http) for API calls

## Model Training (Optional)

If you're developing custom models:

1. Place model training scripts in a separate repository
2. Export trained models to compatible formats (TFLite, etc.)
3. Add model files to the `assets/models/` directory
4. Document model versions and capabilities
